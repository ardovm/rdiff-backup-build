# rdiff-backup-build
Build system for librsync and rdiff-backup

This project is aimed to help building and packaging a distribution of
rdiff-backup for Windows or Linux. This includes compiling from
sources the librsync library.

This project uses Git submodules to indicate which version of
librsync/librsync and rdiff-backup/rdiff-backup must be included.
